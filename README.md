To Run:
=======

go to the project directory and run
`ant`

`./codingchallenge` or `codingchallenge.bat`

You can also include parameters on those scripts

or just run the Main class in eclipse.

There are a few test files that can be used in the solution directory. 
Obviously the one in the junit directory is explicitly used by the junits.
